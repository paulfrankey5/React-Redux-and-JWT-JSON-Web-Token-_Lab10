# React Redux + JWT Mini Project

This is a small project I made to practice **React**, **Redux**, and **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.  
I am still learning, so I built a very simple login example to understand how Redux state changes work and how JWT tokens are returned from a backend server.

---

## What this project does

- User types in username + password
- Frontend sends the data to a small Node.js backend
- Backend checks the fake user and returns a **JWT token**
- I save the token and user info in **Redux**
- After login, the page shows the user info and part of the JWT token

It is not a real authentication system.  
It is only for learning purposes.
